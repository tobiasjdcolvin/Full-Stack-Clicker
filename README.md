# Russ Clicker
### A full-stack clicker game with a leaderboard, final project for csc337

## Get Started:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. `cd` into the **Full-Stack-Clicker** directory
3. Run `npm install express` within the **Full-Stack-Clicker**
    directory - don't worry about the node files, I have put them in the .gitignore
5. `cd` into the **russ_clicker** directory
6. `cd` into the **backend** directory
7. Run `node server.js`
8. Copy and paste the ip it gives you into your browser, this should bring you to index.html, which is the login page.
9. For now, login with the username "username", "Tobinski", or "Slurricane", registering users is not yet implemented.

## How To Contribute:
As a rule of thumb, never start new code while you are on the main branch.
The steps for developing a new feature are as follows:

1. Open up the terminal tab within Visual Studio Code on the bottom while you are in the project directory, also open up the "Source Control" tab on the left.
2. Make sure you are initially on the main branch by running `git checkout main` (the `checkout` command is kind of like `cd`, but for branches, it moves you to the specified branch).
3. Make a new branch for the feature you are working on, by running `git branch branch_name` (replace "branch_name" with what you want to name your branch, probably something related to the feature you want to implement).
4. Now do `git checkout branch_name` to move to the branch you just created.
5. You can make sure you are in the correct branch by running `git status`. You should also see the name of your current branch on the bottom of the Source Control tab on the the left of your screen.
