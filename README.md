# Russ Clicker
### A full-stack clicker game with a leaderboard, final project for csc337

## Instructions For Teammates:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. `cd` into the **Full-Stack-Clicker** directory
3. Run `npm install express` within the **Full-Stack-Clicker**
    directory - don't worry about the node files, I have put them in the .gitignore
5. `cd` into the **russ_clicker** directory
6. `cd` into the **backend** directory
7. Run `node server.js`
8. Copy and paste the url it gives you into your browser, but also add `/game.html` to the end of it. The entire url should
   look something like: `127.0.0.1:50001/game.html`

After following these steps, you should have a working demo from the code I wrote. Try clicking a few times to update the counter and then
reload the page - the value should remain. Now look through the code a bit to familiarize yourself with it. Please make sure that when you commit, before you push,
only the files you want to push were changed and no more. If this is not the case, please add any extra weird files to the .gitignore file or let me know and 
I can do it.
