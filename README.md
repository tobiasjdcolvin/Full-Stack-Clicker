# Russ Clicker
### A full-stack clicker game with a leaderboard, final project for csc337

## Instructions For Teammates:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. `cd` into the **Full-Stack-Clicker** directory
3. Run `npm install express` within the **Full-Stack-Clicker**
    directory - don't worry about the node files, I have put them in the .gitignore
5. `cd` into the **russ_clicker** directory
6. `cd` into the **backend** directory
7. Run `node server.js`
8. Copy and paste the url it gives you into your browser, this should bring you to index.html, which is the login page.
9. For now, login with the username "username", "Tobinski", or "Slurricane", I have simulated database functionality without the database yet, so check out the code.

THIS IS TEST TO FIGURE OUT BRANCHING MERGE CONFLICT HERE!
