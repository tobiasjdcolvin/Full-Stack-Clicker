            <p>Usernames and emails are case sensitive for login and registration. If you would like to experiment with
                an account which already has enough points to purchase and unlock everything, you can login with the
                username “pointcollector” and email address “pointcollector@gmail.com”, no caps. <strong>Please only do
                    this
                    if
                    you are the person grading this project.</strong> Once you have registered and/or logged in, you are
                taken to the
                main game page. Hover over your character and click on it. This gives you points, which you can
                eventually use to buy upgrades and unlock cosmetic items too. Before we go into further detail about the
                purchasable and unlockable upgrades, let's talk about the dynamic online global leaderboard. In the game
                page right under your character, there should be a button labeled “Leaderboard”. Click this button, and
                you should be taken to a page dedicated to the online leaderboard. You will remain logged in, and if you
                want to go back to the game page, all you have to do is click the “Back To Game” button on the top left
                of the page. There are two main sections of the leaderboard page. The first shows The top five global
                players of Russ Clicker. This includes their rank, username, current score (which is dynamically updated
                every second or so), and their currently equipped cosmetic item (labeled “Icon”). Similarly, below this
                top five leaderboard, you can view your own stats, including your dynamically updated score and your
                rank, regardless of if you are in the top five or not. Now, why would it be important to show your own
                score updated every second on the leaderboard? That brings us to the next part of the game. Navigate
                back to the game page, and look to the right of the page. Here you will find all of the purchasable
                gameplay upgrades. The idea here is that you spend points to earn points. So you may need to strategize
                in order to maintain your standing in the global leaderboard. For instance, the very first upgrade is an
                offline point generator. This costs 500 points, and once you purchase this upgrade, you will
                automatically earn 1 point per second without needing to click your character, even while you are logged
                out and afk. The next upgrade you can get costs 5,000 points, and gives you 10 points every time you
                click instead of just 1 point. Finally, for 50,000 points you can get 100 points per click. The next
                major feature of this game is the unlockable cosmetic upgrade system. This is slightly different from
                the purchasable upgrade system in that instead of spending your points, all you have to do is reach a
                certain point threshold, equip your desired item, and you will have it unlocked indefinitely, being able
                to equip it whenever you so desire. Your currently equipped cosmetic will be remembered even after you
                log out, and as long as you have had it equipped at least once, you will be able to swap to it from any
                other equipped item. The first of these cosmetic unlocks is the bronze Russ beard skin. Once you have
                reached 1,000 points, click “Equip”, and from that point onwards, you will be able to equip this item,
                even after you have unlocked others. The next one is the silver Russ beard skin for 10,000 points.
                Finally, there is the ultimate golden Russ beard skin for 100,000 points. You can always log out of Russ
                Clicker from any page by clicking a button located at the top left of the screen.
